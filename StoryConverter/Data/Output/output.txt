a DT

Whole JJ

another DT

There EX

The DT

The DT

How WRB

`` ``

now RB
he PRP

still RB

though IN

The DT
noise NN

not RB

late RB
in IN
the DT
day NN

and CC
even RB
then RB
the DT
poor JJ
little JJ
thing NN
dared VBD
not RB
stir JJ

He PRP
waited VBD
several JJ
hours NNS
before IN
he PRP
looked VBD
around IN
him PRP

and CC
then RB
hurried VBD
away RB
from IN
the DT
moor NN
as RB
fast RB
as IN
he PRP
could MD

He PRP
ran VBD
over IN
fields NNS

meadows NNS
, ,
though IN
the DT
wind NN
was VBD
so RB
high JJ
that IN
he PRP
had VBD
some DT
difficulty NN
in IN

Towards NNS
evening VBG
he PRP
reached VBD
a DT
wretched JJ
little JJ
hut NN

so RB
wretched VBD
that IN
it PRP
knew VBD
not RB
on IN
which WDT
side NN
to TO
fall VB

and CC
therefore RB
remained VBD
standing VBG

The DT
wind NN
blew NN
violently RB
, ,
so IN
that IN
our PRP$
poor JJ
little JJ
Duckling NNP
was VBD
obliged VBN
to TO
support VB
himself PRP
on IN
his PRP$
tail NN
, ,
in IN
order NN
to TO
stand VB
against IN
it PRP
; :
but CC
it PRP
became VBD
worse RBR
and CC
worse JJR
. .
He PRP
then RB
noticed VBD
that IN
the DT
door NN
had VBD
lost VBN
one CD
of IN
its PRP$
hinges NNS
, ,
and CC
hung VBD
so RB
much JJ
awry NN
that IN
he PRP
could MD
creep VB
through IN
the DT
crack NN
into IN
the DT
room NN

So IN
he PRP
went VBD
in IN

In IN
this DT
room NN
lived VBD
an DT
old JJ
woman NN
, ,
with IN
her PRP$
Tom-cat NN
and CC
her PRP$
Hen NNP

The DT
Cat NNP
, ,
whom WP
she PRP
called VBD
her PRP
little JJ
son NN

knew VBD
how WRB
to TO
set VB
up RP
his PRP$

purr NN
; :
indeed RB
, ,
he PRP
could MD
even RB
throw VB
out RP
sparks NNS
when WRB
stroked VBD
the DT
wrong JJ
way NN

The DT
Hen NNP
had VBD
very RB
short JJ
legs NN
, ,
and CC
was VBD
therefore RB
called VBN
`` ``
Chickie NNP
Short-legs NNP

'' ''
She PRP
laid VBD
very RB
good JJ
eggs NNS
, ,
and CC
the DT
old JJ
woman NN
loved VBD
her PRP
as IN
her PRP$
own JJ
child NN

The DT
next JJ
morning NN
the DT
new JJ
guest NN
was VBD
discovered VBN
, ,
and CC
the DT
Cat NNP
began VBD
to TO
mew VB

the DT
Hen NNP
to TO
cackle VB

`` ``
What WP

'' ''
asked VBD
the DT
old JJ
woman NN
, ,
looking VBG
round NN

But CC
her PRP$
eyes NNS
were VBD
not RB
good JJ
, ,
so IN
she PRP
took VBD
the DT
young JJ
Duckling NNP
to TO
be VB
a DT
fat JJ
Duck NNP
who WP
had VBD
lost VBN
her PRP$
way NN

`` ``

she PRP

`` ``

And CC
so RB
the DT
Duckling NN
was VBD
kept VBN
on IN
trial NN
for IN
three CD
weeks NNS

but CC
no DT

Now RB
the DT
Cat NNP

the DT
master NN

the DT
Hen NNP

the DT

and CC
always RB

`` ``

for IN
they PRP
imagined VBD
themselves PRP

not RB
only RB

half NN

but CC
also RB
by IN
far RB
the DT

The DT
Duckling VBG
thought VBD
it PRP

possible JJ

a DT
different JJ
opinion NN

but CC
that IN

Hen NNP
would MD
not RB
allow VB

`` ``

asked VBD

`` ``

`` ``

And CC

`` ``

So IN
the DT
Duckling NNP
sat VBD
alone RB
in IN
a DT
corner NN

and CC
felt VBD
very RB
miserable JJ

However RB

he PRP

The DT

out RB
