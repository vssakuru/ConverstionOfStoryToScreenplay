 In the reign of King Edward the Third there was a poor orphan boy, named  Dick Whittington, living in a country village a long way from London. He  was a sharp little lad, and the stories that a poor orphan boy , named Dick Whittington , living in a country village a long way from London heard of London being  paved with gold made him long to visit that city.One day, a large wagon and eight horses, with bells at their heads,  drove through the village. Dick thought it must be going to London, so  he asked the driver to let him walk by the side of the wagon. As soon as  the driver heard that poor Dick had neither father nor mother, and saw  by his ragged clothes that he could not be worse off than he was, he  told him he might go if he would; so they set off together.

Poor Dick ran till he was tired, and  had quite forgotten his friend the driver. At last, finding it grow  dark, and that every way he turned he saw nothing but dirt instead of  gold, he sat down in a dark corner, and cried himself to sleep. Next  morning, being very hungry, he got up and walked about, and asked  everybody he met to give him a halfpenny to keep him from starving.  At last, a good-natured-looking gentleman saw how hungry he looked.

At last, a good-natured-looking gentleman saw how hungry Dick looked."Why don't you go to work, my lad?" said he.
 "Why don't you go to work, my lad?" said he."I would," answered Dick, "but I do not know how to get any."
 "I would," answered Dick, "but I do not know how to get any.""If you are willing," said the gentleman, "come with me;" and so  saying, he took him to a hayfield, where Dick worked briskly, and lived  merrily till the hay was all made. After this, he found himself as badly  off as before; and being almost starved again, he laid himself down at  the door of Mr. Fitzwarren, a rich merchant. Here the cook, an  ill-tempered woman, called out to poor Dick:

 "Why do you lie there, my lad? you seem old enough to work; I am afraid  you are lazy.""No, sir," said Dick to him. "I would work with all my heart; but I do  not know anybody, and I am sick for want of food."
 "No, sir," said Dick to him. "I would work with all my heart; but I do  not know anybody, and I am sick for want of food.""Poor fellow!" answered Mr. Fitzwarren; "get up, and let me see what  ails you."

He had lived in the family many years, and was an elderly  man, and very kind-hearted. He had once a little son of his own, who  died when about the age of Dick; so he could not help feeling pity for  the poor boy, and sometimes gave him a halfpenny to buy gingerbread or  a top. The footman was fond of reading, and used often in the evening to  entertain the other servants with some amusing book. Little Dick took  pleasure in hearing this good man, which made him wish very much to  learn to read too; so the next time the footman gave him a halfpenny,  he bought a little book with it; and with the footman's help, Dick soon  learnt his letters, and afterwards to read.

As they went,  Miss Alice saw a poor woman with one child in her arms and another on  her back. She pulled out her purse and gave the woman some money; but as  she was putting it into her pocket again, she dropped it on the ground  and walked on. It was lucky that Dick was behind, and saw what she had  done, for he picked up the purse and gave it to her again. Another time,  when Miss Alice was sitting with the window open and amusing herself  with a favorite parrot, it suddenly flew away to the branch of a high  tree, where all the servants were afraid to venture after it. As soon as  Dick heard of this, he pulled off his coat, and climbed up the tree as  nimbly as a squirrel; and, after a great deal of trouble, caught her and  brought her down safely to his mistress. Miss Alice thanked him, and  liked him ever after for this.

His bed stood in a garret, where there  were so many holes in the floor and the walls, that every night he was  waked in his sleep by the rats and mice, which ran over his face, and  made such a noise that he sometimes thought the walls were tumbling down  about him. One day, a gentleman who came to see Mr. Fitzwarren wanted  his shoes polished; Dick took great pains to make them shine, and the  gentleman gave him a penny. With this he thought he would buy a cat; so  the next day, seeing a little girl with a cat under her arm, he went up  to her, and asked if she would let him have it for a penny. The girl  said she would, and that it was a very good mouser. Dick hid the cat in  the garret, and always took care to carry a part of his dinner to her;  and in a short time he had no more trouble from the rats and mice.

They all had some money that  they were willing to venture, except poor Dick, who had neither money  nor goods. For this reason he did not come into the parlor with the  rest; but Miss Alice guessed what was the matter, and ordered him to be  called in. She then said she would put in money for him from her own  purse; but her father told her this would not do, for Dick must send  something of his own. When poor Dick heard this, he said he had nothing  but a cat.

She asked him if he thought his cat would sell for as much money as  would buy a stick to beat him. At last, poor Dick could not bear this  any longer, and thought he would run away from his place; so he packed  up his few things, and set out very early in the morning on the first  of November. He walked as far as Highgate, and there sat down on a  stone, which to this day is called Whittington's stone, and began to  think which road he should take farther. While he was thinking what he  should do, the bells of Bow Church began to ring, and he fancied their  sounds seemed to say:

The people came  in great numbers to see the sailors, and treated them very civilly; and,  when they became better acquainted, were eager to buy the fine things  with which the ship was laden. When the captain saw this, he sent  patterns of the best things he had to the King of the country; who was  so much pleased with them, that he sent for the captain and the chief  mate to the palace. Here they were placed, as is the custom of the  country, on rich carpets, marked with gold and silver flowers. The King  and Queen were seated at the upper end of the room; and a number of  dishes, of the greatest rarities, were brought in for dinner; but,  before they had been on the table a minute, a vast number of rats and  mice rushed in, and helped themselves from every dish. The captain  wondered at this, and asked if these vermin were not very unpleasant.

He came back to the palace soon enough to see the table  full of rats and mice again, and the second dinner likely to be lost in  the same way as the first. The cat did not wait for bidding, but jumped  out of the captain's arm, and in a few moments laid almost all the rats  and mice dead at her feet. The rest, in a fright, scampered away to  their holes.

At last the Queen took  puss on her lap, and by degrees became quite free with her, till puss  purred herself to sleep. When the King had seen the actions of mistress  puss, and was told that she would soon have young ones, which might in  time kill all the rats and mice in his country, he bought the captain's  whole ship's cargo; and afterwards gave him a great deal of gold  besides, which was worth still more, for the cat. The captain then took  leave, and set sail with a fair wind, and arrived safe at London.
