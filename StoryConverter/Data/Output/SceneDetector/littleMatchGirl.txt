 It was dreadfully cold, it was snowing fast, and almost dark; the  evening--the last evening of the Old Year--was drawing in. But cold and  dark as it was, a poor little girl, with bare head and feet, was still  wandering about the streets. When a poor little girl , with bare head and feet left her home a poor little girl , with bare head and feet had slippers on,  but they were much too large for her--indeed, really, they belonged to  her mother--and had dropped off her feet while a poor little girl , with bare head and feet was running very fast  across the road, to get out of the way of two carriages. One of the  slippers was not to be found; the other had been snatched up by a little  boy, who ran off with it thinking it might serve him as a doll's cradle.So the little girl now walked on, her bare feet quite red and blue with  the cold. She carried a small bundle of matches in her hand, and a good  many more in her tattered apron. No one had bought any of them the  livelong day--no one had given her a single penny. Trembling with cold  and hunger she crept on, the picture of sorrow; poor little child!

No one had bought any of them the  livelong day--no one had given her a single penny. Trembling with cold  and hunger she crept on, the picture of sorrow; poor little child!The snowflakes fell on her long fair hair, which curled in such pretty  ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, nor  of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor  of roast goose reached her from several houses. It was New Year's Eve,  and it was of this that she thought.

Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor  of roast goose reached her from several houses. It was New Year's Eve,  and it was of this that she thought.In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the  other, she sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in  vain--she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no  matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat  her. Besides her home was almost as cold as the street--it was an attic;  and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up  with straw and rags, the wind and snow often came through.

She drew one out, and  struck it against the wall. Bravo! it was a bright, warm flame, and she  held her hands over it. It was quite an illumination for that poor  little girl--nay, call it rather a magic taper--for it seemed to her as  though she were sitting before a large iron stove with brass ornaments,  so beautifully blazed the fire within! The child stretched out her feet  to warm them also. Alas! in an instant the flame had died away, the  stove vanished, the little girl sat cold and comfortless, with the  burnt match in her hand.

It kindled and blazed, and  wherever its light fell the wall became transparent as a veil--the  little girl could see into the room within. She saw the table spread  with a snow-white damask cloth, whereon were ranged shining china  dishes; the roast goose, stuffed with apples and dried plums, stood at  one end, smoking hot, and--which was pleasantest of all to see-the  goose, with knife and fork still in her breast, jumped down from the  dish, and waddled along the floor right up to the poor child. Then the  match went out, and only the thick, hard wall was beside her.

And now she was  sitting under a most beautiful Christmas tree, far larger, and far more  prettily decked out, than the one she had seen last Christmas Eve  through the glass doors of the rich merchant's house. Hundreds of wax  tapers lighted up the green branches, and tiny painted figures, such as  she had seen in the shop windows, looked down from the tree upon her.  The child stretched out her hands towards them in delight, and in that  moment the light of the match was quenched. Still, however, the  Christmas candles burned higher and higher--she beheld them beaming  like stars in heaven. One of them fell, the lights streaming behind  it like a long, fiery tail.

It flamed up, and,  surrounded by its light, appeared before her that same dear grandmother,  gentle and loving as always, but bright and happy as she had never  looked during her lifetime.

 She struck yet another match against the wall. It flamed up, and,  surrounded by its light, appeared before her that same dear grandmother,  gentle and loving as always, but bright and happy as the little girl softly had never  looked during her lifetime."Grandmother!" exclaimed the child, "Oh, take me with you! I know you  will leave me as soon as the match goes out. You will vanish like the  warm fire in the stove, like the splendid New Year's feast, like the  beautiful large Christmas tree!" And she hastily lighted all the  remaining matches in the bundle, lest her grandmother should disappear.  And the matches burned with such a blaze of splendor, that noonday could  scarcely have been brighter. Never had the good old grandmother looked  so tall and stately, so beautiful and kind. She took the little girl in  her arms, and they both flew together--joyfully and gloriously they  flew--higher and higher, till they were in that place where neither  cold, nor hunger, nor pain is ever known--they were in Paradise.

The New Year's sun shone on  the lifeless child. Motionless she sat there with the matches in her  lap, one bundle of them quite burnt out.
