 Aladdin was the only son of a poor widow who lived in China; but instead  of helping his mother to earn their living, the only son of a poor widow who lived in China ; let her do all the hard  work, while the only son of a poor widow who lived in China ; himself only thought of idling and amusement.One day, as he was playing in the streets, a stranger came up to him,  saying that he was his father's brother, and claiming him as his  long-lost nephew. Aladdin had never heard that his father had had a  brother; but as the stranger gave him money and promised to buy him  fine clothes and set him up in business, he was quite ready to believe  all that he told him. The man was a magician, who wanted to use Aladdin  for his own purposes.

The man was a magician, who wanted to use Aladdin  for his own purposes.The next day the stranger came again, brought Aladdin a beautiful suit  of clothes, gave him many good things to eat, and took him for a long  walk, telling him stories all the while to amuse him. After they had  walked a long way, they came to a narrow valley, bounded on either side  by tall, gloomy-looking mountains. Aladdin was beginning to feel tired,  and he did not like the look of this place at all. He wanted to turn  back; but the stranger would not let him. He made Aladdin follow him  still farther, until at length they reached the place where he intended  to carry out his evil design. Then he made Aladdin gather sticks to make  a fire, and when they were in a blaze he threw into them some powder,  at the same time saying some mystical words, which Aladdin could not  understand.

The earth  trembled, and burst open at their feet--disclosing a large flat stone  with a brass ring fixed in it. Aladdin was so terribly frightened that  he was about to run away; but the Magician gave him such a blow on the  ear that he fell to the ground.

Under this  stone there is hidden a treasure which will make you richer than the  richest monarch in the world. You alone may touch it. If I assist you  in any way the spell will be broken, but if you obey me faithfully, we  shall both be rich for the rest of our lives. Come, take hold of the  brass ring and lift the stone."

It yielded at once to his touch, and he  was able to lift the great stone quite easily and move it away, which  disclosed a flight of steps, leading down into the ground.

If you  touch anything in the halls you will meet with instant death. The third  hall will bring you into a garden, planted with fine fruit trees. When  you have crossed the garden, you will come to a terrace, where you will  find a niche, and in the niche a lighted lamp. Take the lamp down, and  when you have put out the light and poured away the oil, bring it to me.  If you would like to gather any of the fruit of the garden you may do  so, provided you do not linger."

He passed  through the three halls, crossed the garden, took down the lamp from  the niche, poured out the oil, put the lamp into his bosom, and turned  to go back.As he came down from the terrace, he stopped to look at the trees of the  garden, which were laden with wonderful fruits. To Aladdin's eyes it  appeared as if these fruits were only bits of colored glass, but in  reality they were jewels of the rarest quality. Aladdin filled his  pockets full of the dazzling things, for though he had no idea of their  real value, yet he was attracted by their dazzling brilliance. He had  so loaded himself with these treasures that when at last he came to the  steps he was unable to climb them without assistance.

 "Give me the lamp first," replied the Magician."Really, Uncle, I cannot do so until I am out of this place," answered  Aladdin, whose hands were, indeed, so full that he could not get at the  lamp.
 "Really, Uncle, I cannot do so until I am out of this place," answered  Aladdin, whose hands were, indeed, so full that he could not get at the  lamp.But the Magician refused to help Aladdin up the steps until he had  handed over the lamp. Aladdin was equally determined not to give it up  until he was out of the cavern, and, at last, the Magician fell into a  furious rage. Throwing some more of the powder into the fire, he again  said the magic words. No sooner had he done so than there was a  tremendous thunder-clap, the stone rolled back into its place, and  Aladdin was a prisoner in the cavern. The poor boy cried aloud to his  supposed uncle to help him; but it was all in vain, his cries could not  be heard. The doors in the garden were closed by the same enchantment,  and Aladdin sat down on the steps in despair, knowing that there was  little hope of his ever seeing his Mother again.
