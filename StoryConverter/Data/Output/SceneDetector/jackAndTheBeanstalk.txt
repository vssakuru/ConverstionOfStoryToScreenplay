 Jack was an idle, lazy boy who would do no work to support his widowed  mother; and at last they both came to such poverty that the poor woman  had to sell her cow to buy food to keep them from starving. She sent  Jack to market with the cow, telling him to be sure and sell it for a  good price.As Jack was going along the road to market he met a butcher. The butcher  offered to buy the cow in exchange for a hatful of colored beans. Jack  thought the beans looked very pretty, and he was glad to be saved the  long hot walk to market; so he struck the bargain on the spot and went  back to his mother with the beans, while the butcher went off with the  cow.

"And it is your duty to do  your utmost to destroy the wicked monster. Go now, and see what you can  do. If you can carry off any of his treasures you are at liberty to do  so--for none of them really belongs to him. He has taken them all by  force from the people whom he has robbed and killed."

While Jack was eating  his food in the kitchen there came a loud knocking at the door. The  ogre's wife, in a great flurry, hid Jack in the oven, and then hurried  to let her husband in. Jack peeped through the oven door, and saw a  terrible-looking ogre, who came stamping into the kitchen, and said in  a voice like thunder--

Jack thought that if he could only get this wonderful hen  to take home to his mother, they would never want any more.

The  hen squawked, but the ogre's snoring was like the roaring of the sea  when the tide is coming in, and Jack got safely down the beanstalk.

Jack was enchanted,  for he had never before heard such wonderful music, and he felt that he  must have the harp for his own.
