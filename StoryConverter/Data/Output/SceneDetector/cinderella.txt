 There was once a rich man, whose wife died, leaving him with one little  girl. After some years, hoping to give his child a mother's love and  care, him married again, this time a widow, with two grown-up daughters. But his second wife was haughty and proud, and her two daughters were  even worse than their mother; and the poor little girl had a very  unhappy time with her new relations. Her stepsisters were jealous of  her, for him was very beautiful, and they themselves were plain and  ugly. They did all they could to make her miserable; and, at length,  through their wicked spite and envy, her life became a burden to her. The poor child was sent to live in the kitchen, where him had to do all  the rough and dirty work; and because him was always dressed in rags,  and sat beside the cinders in the grate, they called her Cinderella.It happened that the King of the country had an only son. He was very  anxious that the Prince should be married; so he gave a great ball, and  invited all the grand ladies in the country to come to it. It was to be  a very splendid affair, lasting for three nights, and people were very  eager to be invited to it, for it was known that the Prince would choose  his bride from among the ladies present.

 "Because my mother and sisters have gone to the ball, and I am left here  all alone," said Cinderella."Do you want to go to the ball, too!" said the old lady.
 "Do you want to go to the ball, too!" said the old lady."Yes, but it is no good; I have nothing but rags to wear," sobbed poor  Cinderella.
 "Yes, but it is no good; I have nothing but rags to wear," sobbed poor  Cinderella."Well, well, be a good child and don't cry any more," said the old  woman, briskly.

 Cinderella ran out into the garden and brought in the biggest pumpkin  that she could find."Now go and fetch the mouse-trap out of the cellar," said her Godmother,  and Cinderella hurried to get it. There were six mice in the trap, and  the old woman harnessed them to the pumpkin, put a rat on the top to  drive them, and two lizards behind, and then waved her wand over them.  Immediately the pumpkin turned into a gorgeous coach, the mice into six  beautiful horses, the rat into a stately coachman, and the lizards into  tall footmen, with powdered hair and silk stockings. "There," said the  old woman; "there's a carriage to take you to the ball."
